Change Log
==========

0.1.3
-----

Fix error with importing useTracker correctly after making a local copy.

0.1.2
-----

Include a copy of `useTracker` until the official package is released. This will be removed at some point, please don't rely on it.

0.1.1
-----

**Breaking change**: Changed the format of the return data from an object with data, and loading props named after the connector name or nameProp value, to a tuple. Much simpler, and more flexible, but a breaking change from 0.1.0.

0.1.0
-----

First version!
